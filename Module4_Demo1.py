#2 Differentiate output
# The main difference between the print function and the return function is that the return function instructs the script to continue
#it has while exiting the function, whilst the print function just prints the logic it has when called.

# explain fave_num = 69
# fave_num is a parameter in the defined total function, initially before the change there was no value indicated for the two parameters,
#before line 4 wherein a value was assigned to fave_num and age.
